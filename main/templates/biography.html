        <h1>Biography of Leo Ogle</h1>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="row col-xs-12">
        <p>Leo E. Ogle was born on September 25, 2004 in Rochester, MN. Since he was a wee lad he had always enjoyed serving, and had aspired to do good for all. He has lived in five different houses over 13 years, so you could say he has a pretty diverse background. Since Leo has been going to school at Our Lady of Grace, he has always seen something lacking in our student council. That is respect for the student body. Our student council has consistently bent the knee to the administration, but that will no longer go on, if you elect Leo Ogle as your Student Council President, vote Ogle for office.</p>

         <br>
         <p>Miguel Nunez Mudoy is a name you probably have never heard of, but here is a Moo-ving speach about his life. It all started on the 8th of November 2004 (not 4 days later because I Beef-leif that I am better than that). Then fast forward to some time between 4th and 5th grade, young me decides "If one of my close friends can win the geo bee than I can moo something to!", or something like that. I am not confident at all, in fact very scared I will fail my colleagues. I am counting on your vote.</p>
